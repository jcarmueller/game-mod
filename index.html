        <title>Getting Started</title>
There are at least 2-4 players and one person to narrate the story. 
The players pick a plastic playing piece each. 
The cards must be separated into the four graphic cards and the colored cards. Each pile is shuffled. 

          <title>Rules of Play</title>
Unlike the original game Candy Land, the players fates are less up to chance and more up to the whim of the narrator, whose job it is to weave an interesting story involving the players and the surroundings in the game.

The narrators job is to tell a story that can be about anything, but must involve elements depicted on the game board. 

The game begins with the narrators introduction and the player that is going first draws a colored card. Before each turn the narrator must add an element to the story. 

Every three or four turns, the narrator must draw one card from the candy pile. Each card will add a different element to the story and the order will determine how the story will be told. 
The person whose turn is next after the candy card is drawn is at the whim of the narrator who can decide to bump them up or move them back to the space with the candy which was drawn. 

If you draw a card with one color block you move to the next space with that color. 
If you draw a card with two color blocks you move two spaces forward with that color.

Purple cards will result in the loss of one turn due to a serious injury that prevents the traveler from moving on. 
Yellow cards are sickness that can spread to other players if they are 1-3 spaces away from you. 
All players in that zone cannot move more than one space forward for the next two turns, even if they draw a card with two color blocks on it. 
If you draw a green card directly after you have been infected you will be cured. If you were not previously sick the card is treated normally. 
Red, orange and blue cards have no special properties and are treated normally. 

If you are currently on a licorice space, you are immune to all injury and illness cards that you draw.

If you land on a shortcut space, you are at the discretion of the narrator who will decide whether or not to let you pass. 

          <b>Choose your narrator wisely and have safe travles!</b>
